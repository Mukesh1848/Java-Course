// Types of Locks 
// 1. Intrinsic -> These are build into every object in java. you don;t see them, but they are there.When you use a synchronized keyword, you're using these automatic locks.
// 2. Explicit -> these are more advanced locks you can control ypurself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks. You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control over how and when people write in the notebook.
